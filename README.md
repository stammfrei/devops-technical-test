# Technical test

## Assignment

DEVOPS TEST : ## OPS terraform / ansible / packer / docker test
For this exercise, we would like you to use tools like Terraform, Packer, and Ansible.

The goal is to set up a WordPress container on an ECS cluster.

We would like you to use Packer with the Ansible provisioner to create a "ready to use" WordPress image that will use an rds database.
The goal is not to use a fork but to do it by yourself. We are interested in the “how” and the result.

You can use AWS free tier usage: don't waste money!
We would like you to publish your image on a git repository (Github or BitBucket), with a README file explaining:

- How did you approach the test?
- How did you run your project?
- What components interact with each other
- What problems did you encounter?
- How would you have done things to achieve the best HA/automated architecture?
- Please share any ideas you have to improve this kind of infrastructure

In the README, please also answer the following question:
Tomorrow we want to put this project in production. What would be your advice 
and choices to achieve that? In other words, the infrastructure and external
services like monitoring, etc.

As this test is done in your free time, we understand if it's not perfect or if you don’t have time to go deeper.
Just tell us in the README file how you would have done this.
